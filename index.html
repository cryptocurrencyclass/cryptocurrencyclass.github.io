<h1>Cryptocurrency Class 2022</h1>
<p>All lecture and teaching material is developed by Patrick McCorry. All material is open-source and it is free to access, use modify or share.</p>
<p>The field of cryptocurrency is trust engineering. 
It applies cryptography, distributed systems and mechanism design as the foundation for a global and self-sustaining peer-to-peer network.
</p>

<p>
This course is taught in the style of an MSc module. We'll study how something like Bitcoin can work, the implications and beauty of self-enforcing smart contracts, and focus on bringing all students up to date with state-of-the-art research in this emerging area. There is a special focus for off-chain protocols. This includes the history of payment channels (the lightning network) and validating bridges (rollups).</p>

<h2>Target audience</h2>

<p>Our goal is to provide educational material (and the correct mental model) to allow bystanders to join the cryptocurrency community. Anyone with a slight technical background can benefit from this course. No programming experience required, but it will be helpful for some of the exercises.</p>

<p>We are hoping to start the course towards the end of Feburary. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdSCdnbDPlSJL5xU7iqIA8sODBS8_xRpYb2S-jn_AL_4QB_dg/viewform" >Click here to sign up and join us!</a></p>

<h2>Outline Of Syllabus</h2>

<ul>

<li>Nakamoto consensus and public databases</li>
<li>Role of game theory and cryptography</li>
<li>Structure of the blockchain</li>
<li>Building and breaking smart contracts</li>
<li>On-chain scalability bottlenecks</li>
<li>Plasma to Rollups</li>
<li>Validating bridges</li>
<li>History of state channels </li>
<li>Repayment protocols and synchrony</li>

</ul>

<h2> Organisational Structure </h2>

<h3>Workshop-style course</h3>
<p>We plan to conduct one lecture a week and eight lectures in total. Patrick McCorry will perform all lectures over zoom to a small audience (~30 pre-selected participants). The class will be streamed online (Youtube or Twitch) to allow anyone to attend, watch and participate. </p>

<p>
While the prepared content should benefit the audience, the workshop-style lecture lets the audience ask questions and diverge from the content to help aid the learning experience. As such, one hour of lecture material is planned for a 90-120 minute session. 
</p>

<h3>Portfolio, not certification.</h3>
<p>There is no explicit or graded assessment. We encourage participants to build a portfolio of work and experiment with different aspects of cryptocurrency.</p>

<h3>External sponsors and content</h3>

<p>Unlike other events, it is ideal for sponsors to approach us after the masterclass has concluded. It is a community-driven masterclass and assuming it is successful, we want sponsors to focus on how we can make it sustainable in the future.</p>

<p>There will be no additional lectures or workshops from external companies during the 8 week mastercourse. This is to avoid over-exhausting the participants or presenting content in a way that confuses the participants. We may include some interactive panel sessions with industry experts to discuss some of the material presented. </p>

<h3>Free for all</h3>
<p>There is no fee to participate. Our goal is to help bystanders join the cryptocurrency community and provide a level playing field for all. It is very possible this venture makes no money, but who cares when we are all having fun.</p>
